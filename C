In this question, it is mentioned we have an array of length n, of distict integers. This is called a permutation of length n. {Eg. n=6 => [6,2,1,3,4,5]},
    and we wish to find the maximum money we can have at any time. 
Here we are only picking every lth and rth numbers, so we can selectively set these numbers and the rest are inconsequential.
So we are picking (n//l) {called x} numbers to add and (n//r) {called y} numbers to subtract money. {a//b is floor division of a by b} 
Now we will be also be picking (n//lcm(l,r)){called z} numbers twice, and so they would have no net effect on our maximum.
Note: z<=min(x,y)
Then we have (x-z) numbers being added, so we pick the (x-z) maximum numbers to be added {which are n-(x-z-1), n-(x-z-2), ......, n-1, n}.
Then we have (y-z) numbers being subtracted, so we pick the (y-z) minimum numbers to be subtracted {which are 1, 2, ......, y-z-1, y-z}.
Calculating from the above numbers gives us the answer.

Complexity: O(log(x*y)) {The entire solution is O(1) except the lcm funtion which uses the extended eucledian algorithm, whose complexity is log(x)+log(y).}
