The question states that we want k fields of equal productivity, while maximizing individual productivity.
So we pick the k most productive fields and knock them down to the productivity of the kth field. 

Complexity: O(nlog(n)) {Because of sorting}

from sys import stdin,stdout
input=lambda :stdin.readline()[:-1]
def solve():
    n,k = map(int,(input().split()))    
    a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
    print(a[n-k])

    
for _ in range(int(1)):
    solve()
